      information.
    </p>

    <p>

    <p>

    </p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      <b>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</b>
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to
      explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal
      information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process
      your personal information:
    </p>

    <p>
      Consent. We may process your information if you have given us permission
      (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose.

    </p>

    <p>
      Legal Obligations. We may process your information where we believe it is
      necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate
      with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our
      legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in
      which we are involved.
    </p>

    <p>
      Vital Interests. We may process your information where we believe it is

    <p>
      <b>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</b>
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      We may process your information if you have given us specific permission
      (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific
      purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e.,
      implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time.
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable
      law to process your information without your consent, including, for
      example:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent
        cannot be obtained in a timely way
      </li>

      <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>

      <li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>

      <li>
        If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is
        necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim
      </li>

      <li>
        For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with
        next of kin
      </li>

      <li>
        If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or
        may be victim of financial abuse
      </li>

      <li>
        If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would
        compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the
        collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach
        of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province
      </li>

      <li>
        If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court
        order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records
      </li>

      <li>
        If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment,
        business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the
        purposes for which the information was produced
      </li>

      <li>
        If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary
        purposes
      </li>

      <li>
        If the information is publicly available and is specified by the
        regulations
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      <b>4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</b>
    </p>

    <p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      <b>5. WHAT IS OUR STANCE ON THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES?</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      The Services may link to third-party websites, online services, or mobile
      applications and/or contain advertisements from third parties that are not
      affiliated with us and which may link to other websites, services, or
      applications. Accordingly, we do not make any guarantee regarding any such
      third parties, and we will not be liable for any loss or damage caused by
      the use of such third-party websites, services, or applications. The
      inclusion of a link towards a third-party website, service, or application
      does not imply an endorsement by us. We cannot guarantee the safety and
      privacy of data you provide to any third parties. Any data collected by
      third parties is not covered by this privacy notice. We are not
      responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies
      of any third parties, including other websites, services, or applications
      that may be linked to or from the Services. You should review the policies
      of such third parties and contact them directly to respond to your

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><b>6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</b></p>

    <p>
      We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary
      for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention
      period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other
      legal requirements).
    </p>

    <p>
      When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
      information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if
      this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has
      been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal
      information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is
      possible.
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
